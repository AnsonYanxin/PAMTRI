## Introduction

We address the problem of vehicle re-identification using multi-task learning and embeded pose representations. Since manually labeling images with detailed pose and attribute information is prohibitive, we train the network with a combination of real and randomized synthetic data. 

The proposed framework consists of two convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are shown in the figure below. Top:  The pose estimation network is an extension of [high-resolution network (HRNet)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09212) for predicting keypoint coordinates (with confidence/visibility) and generating heatmaps/segments. Bottom:  The multi-task network uses the embedded pose information from HRNet for joint vehicle re-identification and attribute classification.

## Getting Started

### Environment

The code was developed and tested with Python 3.6 on Ubuntu 16.04, using a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU card. Other platforms or GPU card(s) may work but are not fully tested.

### Code Structure

Please refer to the `README.md` in each of the following directories for detailed instructions. 

- [PoseEstNet directory](PoseEstNet): The modified version of [HRNet](https://github.com/leoxiaobin/deep-high-resolution-net.pytorch) for vehicle pose estimation. The code for training and testing, keypoint labels, and pre-trained models are provided. 

- [MultiTaskNet directory](MultiTaskNet): The multi-task network for joint vehicle re-identification and attribute classification using embedded pose representations. The code for training and testing, attribute labels, predicted keypoints, and pre-trained models are provided.
